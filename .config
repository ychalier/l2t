# When computing the score of a song,
# it averages between a fame score,
# based on views, and a quality score
# based on likes (more or less). The
# weights of this average are those:
#
# WEIGHT_FAME=2
# WEIGHT_QUALITY=1



# When using the search engine on the
# webpage, a 'match' score is computed
# based on how the song genres match
# the query. If it matches the most
# important noun, it is a main match.
# If it matches an adjective-like word,
# it is a sub match. Those are worth:
#
# MATCH_SCORE_MAIN=3
# MATCH_SCORE_SUBS=1
#
# Once this is done, the final results
# are ordered with a score averaging
# the match score previously computed
# with the song score.
#
# WEIGHT_SONG_SCORE=1
# WEIGHT_MATCH_SCORE=1

# Correspondences:
# To handle typos and synonimity across
# genres, the software uses this table
# to map the corresponding genre.
#
# Syntax is the following:
# main genre:sub genre;sub genre; sub genre

# Default correspondences are hard-coded.
# If one line in this configuration file
# starts with CORR, then the default map
# is totally emptied and replaced by the
# lines from this file.
